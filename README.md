# simple-ruby-test
Simple elisp file that can run ruby tests in various ways

I wrote this a long time ago and found it usefull for quite a while. I almost
lost this code, so decided to make a public repo for it. This may or may not
still be usefull, but I am not using it any more. I tend to just pop out to a
terminal and run my tests there.
